## Data Structures

In this section, you'll find implementations of various data structures using Python. Understanding data structures is crucial for writing efficient code and solving complex problems. Some of the data structures included are:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Hash Tables

Each data structure comes with explanations, examples, and Python implementations.

## Algorithms

Here, we delve into various algorithms used for problem-solving and optimizing code performance. Some of the algorithms covered include:
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Divide and Conquer
- String Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.)

Each algorithm is accompanied by explanations, examples, and Python implementations.

## LeetCode

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding problems, particularly for technical interviews. In this section, we tackle various problems from LeetCode using Python. Each problem solution includes the problem statement, explanation of the approach, and Python implementation.
