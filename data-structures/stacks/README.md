# Stacks Data Structure

In this repository, you'll find everything you need to understand and implement stacks efficiently using Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to brush up on data structures, this guide will walk you through the fundamentals of stacks and their real-world applications in software engineering.

## What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates: you can only remove the top plate, and you can only add a new plate on top of the stack.

### Key Operations:

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Real-World Applications:

### 1. Function Calls:

In programming languages, function calls are managed using a stack-like structure known as the call stack. When a function is called, its local variables and execution context are pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, its frame is popped from the stack, and control returns to the caller.

### 2. Expression Evaluation:

Stacks are often used to evaluate expressions, both arithmetic and logical. Infix, postfix, and prefix expressions can be converted to postfix (or prefix) notation, which can then be evaluated efficiently using a stack.

### 3. Undo Functionality:

Many applications, such as text editors and graphic design software, implement undo functionality using stacks. Each action that modifies the document or design is pushed onto a stack. When the user requests to undo an action, the most recent action is popped from the stack, reverting the document/design to its previous state.

### 4. Browser History:

Web browsers use a stack to implement the back and forward buttons. Each time a user navigates to a new page, the current URL is pushed onto the stack. Pressing the back button pops the top URL from the stack, navigating the user to the previous page.

### 5. Memory Management:

Stacks play a crucial role in memory management, especially in low-level programming languages like C and C++. Local variables, function parameters, and return addresses are typically stored on the stack. When a function is called, its parameters and return address are pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its frame is popped from the stack, deallocating memory.

## Getting Started:

To get started with stacks in Python, simply navigate to the `stacks.py` file in this repository. You'll find implementations of the stack data structure along with examples of how to use them.
